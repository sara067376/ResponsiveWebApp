# Responsive web App – Educational Demo

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is created purely for educational and learning purposes. It is a static clone inspired by the Binance landing page UI and is **not affiliated, associated, or endorsed by Binance** or any cryptocurrency service.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

This landing page is meant to help me practice frontend development skills, including:

- HTML and CSS
- Responsive design
- UI/UX layout
- Component structuring

## 🚫 Important Notes

- This is a **non-functional prototype**. No login, trading, or data collection is implemented.
- No sensitive information is collected or stored.
- No financial operations or services are available through this project.
- This project does not use Binance’s official APIs, backend systems, or trademarks (beyond limited visual inspiration).

## 🔐 Hosting Safety

To avoid red flags:
- Buttons like "Login", "Trade Now", and "Sign Up" are disabled or redirected.
- The project includes a visible disclaimer on the live demo.
- Indexing is disabled to keep the site unlisted in search engines.
